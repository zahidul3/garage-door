# garage-door

The garage door can be *hacked* to be opened by any wireless system. In this case, we will use BLE to control an existing garage door without changing existing functionality. 

We will attach a wireless board to the wall switch that is wired to the garage door unit. A smartphone or any other BLE devices with sufficient authorization will be able to access the garage door.
